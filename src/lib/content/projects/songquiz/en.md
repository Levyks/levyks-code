Web-based game where you guess the song title/artist after listening to a bit of it.

To play, just provide a SpotifyÂ© playlist URL, and invite some friends to join you.

### Notice
I'm currently working on a v2 of this game, which will be released some time in the future.

It will have much cleaner code, since this was built when I was just learning Svelte and I didn't really have a good idea of what I was doing lol.

Major changes:
- TypeScript in both front-end and back-end
- Much cleaner events architecture for communication
- Better UI based on MaterialUI
- More polished gameplay experience
